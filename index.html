                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p><span style="color: red;">L</span>et me introduce myself. My name is Sergii Logosha. I am 33 years old. I live in a beautiful city Kharkiv that lokated in Eastern Ukraine. I have a big family and a lot of friends. I work as a mechanical engineer.</p>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Every person in this huge world has some hobby. Some people have more then one. Hobbies take us out of our everyday experience and give us a chance to do something we love and are passionate about. Engaging in a hobby can be a mental escape, help us hone a skill, or just provide an opportunity to socialize with others. Hobbies are a great way to disconnect from work and break away from the monotony of daily schedules. Also, even though it may seem daunting to add ONE MORE THING to your to-do list, having a hobby has been shown to be a stress reliever. Let me tell you what I like to do in my spare time.</p>

                <h2>Reading books</h2>
                    <div class="paragraph clearfix">
                        <p class="fig"><img src="Images/top-view-of-young-redhead-male-student-preparing-for-university-exam_171337-10015.jpg" width="300" alt="Something went wrong!"/>
                        <p><span style="color: red;">I</span> spend a lot of my free time reading. I am a very curious person. I love to learn a new stuff.</p>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Reading is an incredibly inexpensive hobby that provides so many benefits.</p>
                            <p>A single good-sized book will provide you with many hours of entertainment. Depending on the size of the book, a book will take me between two and twenty hours to read. A larger book, naturally, is at the higher end of that scale. It’s something that will involve me over a period of time.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Alternately, a single good-sized book will provide you with knowledge or enlightenment (and, sometimes, entertainment as well). A good book will make you think about some aspect of the world around you and make you reconsider that aspect a little, whether it’s human relationships, some aspect of the physical world, or an intriguing new idea.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Even better, that single good-sized book can be acquired for practically nothing at your local library or used bookstore. Your local library has thousands of books that you can borrow for free. Your local used bookstore has thousands of books you can keep for just a pittance. The acquisition of a book is very inexpensive, particularly when you look at it per hour spent reading the book.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>My favourite writers are: Erich Maria Remark, Fedor Dostoevskii, Boris Pasternak, Victor Suvorov, Dan Brown and many others.</p>

                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p><span style="color: red;">H</span>obby electronics has been around ever since electronics has been there. Way back, people used to build stuff with vacuum tubes (or valves), then came the transistor and it is now stuff like Raspberry Pi computer boards and such digital projects. However, it would perhaps be incorrect to say that no one or very few people build valve-based audio amplifiers. There is interest for both analog and digital hobby electronics. Even something like assembling your own desktop personal computer gives immence joy.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Using a piece of equipment that you have built with your own hands is thrilling and I certainly was thrilled. An additional advantage is that you can save money through the do-it-yourself route. If you take a pair of loudspeakers, a DIY job will save you at least two-thirds of the cost for something that is similar sounding as compared to buying readymade stuff.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Building electronics is a great hobby. It keeps the mind busy, one has a great way to spend free time and the fruits of labour are very sweet indeed.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Creating differentelectronic gadgets give me an opportunity to feelmyself as a Creator. It is unbelievable feeling. Try and you will love it.</p>

                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p><span style="color: red;">T</span>ravelling may be an expensive hobby but it compensates for the financial loss. If a traveller has interest in life and its manifestations, he can explore a lot to keep himself absorbed and happy. A student of sociology can gather much from the customs and rituals of life of the people living in different regions of the world. A student of history can discover a vivid account of history in the historical monuments. An engineer can enrich his knowledge by looking at the engineering feats at different places. In fact, one can find everything that satisfies one’s intellectual and adventurous cravings.</p>

                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>As a hobby, travelling keeps us busy during leisure; it is the best method to utilise time. Until a person breaks from the dull routine, physically and mentally, he cannot find satisfaction; travelling helps us to achieve this break and rejuvenates us. At a new place, one is curious to know and eager to gather information. He gets thrills and surprises that keep his interests alive.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>While travelling, one comes across a large number of people. In case one has a psychological bent of mind one increases one’s experience and power to understand others. Understanding human nature is perhaps the best part of education. Travelling satisfies all the demands of a good hobby; it is absorbing, educative and refreshing for the mind and the body.</p>

                                <p><span style="color: red;">N</span>o matter how many hobbies you have right now, it’s a good idea to throw in some form of exercise. Why? 5 Reasons. Actually, there are a lot more but I will try to cram as many ideas in to help you make exercise your hobby</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                1. Exercise can help you live longer. There are so many physical reasons why exercise can enable you to live longer such as helping to control your weight, can be good for your heart, can prevent disease and many more. This shouldn’t be a surprise. This is a common message on TV, news, Internet, you name it. But are you doing it?
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                2. Exercise is good for your brain. Another common draw is that exercise can stimulate brain activity. How awesome is that? That’s enough reason to dust off your gym shoes and get outside for a walk!
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                3. Exercise is good for improving relationships. Some exercises can be done alone while others can be done in a group or team. You can build great relationships with people who are interested in the same exercise that you are. You may not have anything else in common and that’s ok. Having a better body also helps improve your personal relationships. Whether it is the confidence that exercise gives you or the fabulous way it makes you look, exercise helps create your irresistible attraction.
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                4. Exercise puts you in a good mood. It has been proven that exercising releases endorphins (the feel good hormone). Any exercising. So if you are fighting stress, a bad mood or depression, it’s seriously time to consider exercising as your hobby.
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                5. Exercise is fun. If you aren’t used to exercising, you may think this reason is nuts. You may be out of shape and have not really exercised in years. That’s ok. You can start now with where you are and whatever you can do. Begin with walking and then go from there. If you keep at it, you will find that exercise can be fun when you pick out something that you like to do and then do it long enough to get those endorphins going. You will see.

                                <p><span style="color: red;">I</span> love to do photos of a beautiful places, funny situations. Looking
                               through them later brings me back to those valuable moments.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                <p>Taking pictures is completely personal. You do not need a fancy camera or a creative background to start taking pictures and making improvements. There are lots of easy and fun things to learn about composition, light, exposure, and editing that will easily and quickly take anyone’s photos up to the next level.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                <p>There are endless ways to challenge yourself with photography; you can always learn something new. There is no shortage of new techniques, genres, projects, equipment, inspiration, and workshops to take in this field.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                <p>Photography helps you capture anything you feel is important to remember. One photograph is powerful enough to not only remind you of an event or detail, but can bring you right back to the feelings, sounds, and even smells of the moment. With every picture, you are telling your family’s unwritten stories and giving them that gift to keep and pass along.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">

                                <p>Photography is a hobby that you can make improvements quickly and see your progress easily. If you line up your photos next to each other from month to month, you will see those changes. In one year, those differences will be significant. Not only will you see how much better you are, seeing some of your favorites each month will give you that extra bit of motivation to keep clicking away.</p>
