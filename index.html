                        <p><span style="color: red;">L</span>et me introduce myself. My name is Sergii Logosha. I am 33 years old. I live in a beautiful city Kharkiv that lokated in Eastern Ukraine. I have a big family and a lot of friends. I work as a mechanical engineer.</p>

                            <p>Every person in this huge world has some hobby. Some people have more then one. Hobbies take us out of our everyday experience and give us a chance to do something we love and are passionate about. Engaging in a hobby can be a mental escape, help us hone a skill, or just provide an opportunity to socialize with others. Hobbies are a great way to disconnect from work and break away from the monotony of daily schedules. Also, even though it may seem daunting to add ONE MORE THING to your to-do list, having a hobby has been shown to be a stress reliever. Let me tell you what I like to do in my spare time.</p>

                        <p><span style="color: red;">I</span> spend a lot of my free time reading. I am a very curious person. I love to learn a new stuff.</p>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Reading is an incredibly inexpensive hobby that provides so many benefits.</p>
                            <p>A single good-sized book will provide you with many hours of entertainment. Depending on the size of the book, a book will take me between two and twenty hours to read. A larger book, naturally, is at the higher end of that scale. It’s something that will involve me over a period of time.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Alternately, a single good-sized book will provide you with knowledge or enlightenment (and, sometimes, entertainment as well). A good book will make you think about some aspect of the world around you and make you reconsider that aspect a little, whether it’s human relationships, some aspect of the physical world, or an intriguing new idea.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Even better, that single good-sized book can be acquired for practically nothing at your local library or used bookstore. Your local library has thousands of books that you can borrow for free. Your local used bookstore has thousands of books you can keep for just a pittance. The acquisition of a book is very inexpensive, particularly when you look at it per hour spent reading the book.</p>
